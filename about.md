I am a software developer with experience in both web and mobile development using asp.net (legacy and core) MVC, Xamarin and UWP.

Until recently, I lead the Aspiration Webbers workshop at Microsoft tech club Cairo university, a student activity which is dedicated to help students to develop web and mobile apps that are market ready apps, In this role I was focused on delivering sessions about client side and server side technologies.

I am also focused on putting my passion and skills to good use by supporting projects and organisations that i care about whether it's by giving some time to give a training session about some topic or a technology that i am passionate about or contributing to an open source project.

I love meeting new people and learning new things so please feel free to say hello and share a story with me.
